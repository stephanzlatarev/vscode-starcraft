When watching a replay or a game of your bot, you have control over the speed of the game.
You can also pause and skip back and forth.
Some controls are available only when watching a replay or when playing a game.

# Common controls

The following controls are available when watching a replay or when playing a game:

* Change the speed between `🏃 Fast speed`, `🕙 Clock time`, `x2 slower`, `x4 slower`, `x8 slower`, `x16 slower`, or `⏸ Paused`. You can use `Spacebar` key when the focus is on the camera view to pause or resume to the previous speed
* While paused, move one frame back or forth. This is limited to 10 seconds before the time the game was paused
* Use `👁 TOGGLE FOG` to enable and disable fog of war. When your bot is playing, you change the fog for your bot
